# Hello! Welcome to the Creative Coding Code Lab!
My name is Caroline Hermans!

## Set up:
1. If you don't have a text editor, download Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
2. Download p5.js: https://p5js.org/download/
3. Introduce yourself to someone

## Schedule:
- (5 min) [Intro: What is Creative Coding?](https://github.com/carolinehermans/devfest-p5-workshop/blob/master/intro.md)
- (5 min) [Lesson 1: The Canvas](https://github.com/carolinehermans/devfest-p5-workshop/blob/master/Lesson1.md)

### Note: There is way more to learn about p5.js than I can possibly pack into 30 minutes! After today, I hope you'll all have the tools to go continue exploring the wonderful world of creative coding.
